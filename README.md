A proof of concept I made in my free time for my work at Husqvarna Robotics R&D. The background is we use Unity WebGL to present a 3D live digi-double environment in the browser. The whole workflow between Blazor and Unity was painful and I wanted to make it easier and better. This project inspired by my work on https://github.com/tifye/react-aseprite and after learning about how the Reacter renderer works, and about React Three Fiber. Here I utilize the lifecycle methods of Blazor components to bind/map to GameObjects in Unity. 

We went on to making full use of this in out internal tools. This project was the inspiration for the follow up [BlazorThreeJs](https://github.com/tifye/BlazorThreeJs/tree/master).
